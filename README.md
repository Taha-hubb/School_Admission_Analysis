## 📘 Overview

This professional R project was developed for the **Ecole Nationale d'Architecture d'Agadir (ENA Agadir)**. The purpose is to analyze student application data and select the top candidates for admission using transparent, reproducible, and statistically sound criteria.

The analysis covers pre-exam filtering, regional and academic distribution, exam performance analysis, and final selection with visualizations.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Integrate data from ENA Rabat and Ministry of Education
* Handle duplicate entries and foreign Baccalauréat
* Filter candidates based on academic performance and eligibility
* Process entrance exam scores (QCM + DEG)
* Calculate final scores and select top candidates
* Generate final and waiting lists
* Visualize key insights (e.g., age, region, filière)

## 📌 Key Features

* 🔄 Data integration from multiple sources
* 🧼 Data cleaning & type coercion
* 🔍 Duplicate detection and resolution
* 📈 Visualization using `ggplot2`
* 📊 Analysis of eligibility filters (grade thresholds, age)
* 📝 Entrance exam performance processing (QCM & DEG)
* 🏆 Final selection and waiting list logic

## 💡 Sample Insights

* 2669 raw applicants, 1975 eligible, 1000 selected
* Filtering steps include:

  * Valid Baccalauréat
  * Regional and National averages >= 12
  * Age ≤ 22
  * Highest calculated average (moy\_calcule) kept for duplicates
* Selection based on combined QCM and DEG scores

## 📉 Visualizations

* Top filières by applicant count
* Distribution of selected students by region
* Correlation between high school GPA and entrance test performance
